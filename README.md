* Silverstripe 4.x
* Silverstripe Elemental

# Installation
* Install the code with `composer require dorsetdigital/silverstripe-element-imagetext`

# Usage
This module adds a simple way to add a content block with an HTML image
By default, the module doesn't add any styling, it expects you to do this in your own CSS file

A snippet of SCSS is included in the docs, designed to work with Bootstrap 4, which provides some basic layout for the element.
